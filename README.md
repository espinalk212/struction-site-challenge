## Challenges Faced
- Issue when moving a Marker and then clicking on the map, the Marker returns back to it's original position
- Tried styling the Marker Icon and adding `transform: rotate()` but unable to do so, found npm package that rotates the Marker Icon
- Issue setting the bounds of the ImageOverlay so user is still able to click outside to a certain extent
